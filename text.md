#  Choices 
<ins>I chose to make this repository public because I don't care about anyone seeing it.</ins> I chose the **MIT liscense** because I don't care about people copying or sharing _this repository_. I chose not to include a README because I knew I would explain everything here. I suppose this could've been the README. ~~strikethrough~~
